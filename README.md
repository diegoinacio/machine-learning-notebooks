# Machine Learning Notebooks

[![Machine Learning Notebooks](docs/assets/images/social-preview.png)](https://diegoinacio.github.io/machine-learning-notebooks/)

This is an `authorial set` of fundamental _Python recipes_ in notebook format. I started this project with the sole purpose of helping people to understand **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** concepts as clearly and succinctly as I could.

In addition, I also developed a bit more appealing way to publish these notebooks, in order to make the experience a little more pleasant and productive. You can check it by visiting the [cookbook page](https://diegoinacio.github.io/machine-learning-notebooks/).

This project is part of the collection [Python Notebooks](https://diegoinacio.github.io/python-notebooks/), which is a gathering of cookbooks on **Computer Science**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision** and more.
